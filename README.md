# Number Guessing Game

This program is a fun number guessing game written in C. The goal is to guess a random number between 1 and 100. Here's how it works:

1. The program generates a random number when it starts.
2. You need to guess the number by typing your guess.
3. The program will provide hints:
   - If your guess is **too high**, it tells you to guess lower.
   - If your guess is **too low**, it tells you to guess higher.
   - If your guess is **close** (within 10 of the actual number), you’ll get encouraging hints.
4. It keeps track of how many tries you’ve taken and congratulates you when you guess the correct number.

To run this program, compile it using a C compiler and execute the compiled file.
