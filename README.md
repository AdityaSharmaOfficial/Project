   - **Too High**: The guess is higher than the random number.
   - **Too Low**: The guess is lower than the random number.
   - **Close Guess**: Encouraging hints for guesses closer to the random number.
4. The program keeps track of the number of tries and congratulates the user upon a correct guess.
